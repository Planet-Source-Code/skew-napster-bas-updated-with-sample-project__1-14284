### Description

This bas let you interact with the Napster program though api calls, letting you create programs such as bots or many other things. There are a couple of these around but this bas has a lot more subs and functions making it much easier to program. Over 36 subs and functions included. I have updated it with new functions and a sample project of what can be done with the bas.
